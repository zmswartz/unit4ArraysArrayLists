Introduction

The goal of this lab is to apply your understanding of 2D arrays to implement
	a complex algorithm. In addition, you will implement a unit test for your
	program using the JUnit framework and create documentation for your
	program using JavaDoc.

One common application of computing is signal analysis. In real-world
	applications, the data that is processed is a combination of something of
	interest (the signal) and garbage that obscures the signal (noise).
	Computational techniques for signal analysis are prevalent in a wide
	variety of scientific and financial applications. This lab provides a
	simplified context in which to explore signal analysis. Conceptually, the
	techniques you will use in this lab are similar to those used in particle
	physics experiments.

Requirements

* Write a Monster Early Warning program that finds a moving monster based on
	the data from your noisy radar system. This is described in DataGenetics
	blog post, "Detecting Signals in Noise." The sample code in GitHub
	implements the case of a stationary monster. You may leverage this code
	to implement the case of a moving monster, which is more complicated.
* Design your program such that the initial position and velocity (dx and dy)
	of the monster can be specified interactively (e.g., from a user) or as
	parameters (e.g., for your unit test).
* Implement a unit test for your program that tests multiple cases.
* Document your code with standard JavaDoc comments.
